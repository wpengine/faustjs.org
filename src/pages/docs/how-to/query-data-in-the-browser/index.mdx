When you query data in the browser, you're leveraging Apollo's `useQuery` hook within your React components.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is client-side data fetching, which means the data is fetched after your page renders in the browser **rather than at build time or request time on the server**. This can be very beneficial and powerful. It can also cause performance and SEO issues. Be sure to understand the implications of client-side data fetching before using it in your project.

## 0. Prerequisites

If you haven't already, follow the [Basic Setup](/docs/how-to/basic-setup/) steps to get Faust.js set up.

## 1. Create a new page

Create a new page in your Next.js app. For this example we'll create a new page called `client.js` in the `pages` directory. This client can also be used in any component.

```js title="page/client.js"
export default function Page(props) {
	return <h1>Client Page</h1>;
}
```

Make sure you can navigate to this page in your browser.

## 2. Adding the Apollo Client

To query data in the browser, you need to import the `useQuery` from the `@apollo/client` package. This hook will execute queries using the same client used by templates on the server.

```js title="page/client.js" {1,4}
import { gql, useQuery } from "@apollo/client";

export default function Page(props) {
	const { data } = useQuery();

	return <h1>Client Page</h1>;
}
```

## 3. Adding a Query

It's time to write our GraphQL query to fetch some data. For this example we'll be fetching the site title and description from your WP site's general settings.

```js {4,9-17} title="page/client.js"
import { gql, useQuery } from "@apollo/client";

export default function Page(props) {
	const { data } = useQuery(Page.query);

	return <h1>Client Page</h1>;
}

Page.query = gql`
	query {
		generalSettings {
			title
			description
		}
	}
`;
```

> [!TIP]:
> While it's can be convinient to co-locate a GraphQL query within the same file. You can also import and use queries from an external file.

## 4. Displaying the Data

Now that we have our query, we can display the data on the page.

```js {5, 7-12} title="page/client.js"
import { gql, useQuery } from "@apollo/client";

export default function Page(props) {
	const { data } = useQuery(Page.query);
	const { title, description } = data.generalSettings;

	return (
		<>
			<h1>{title}</h1>
			<p>{description}</p>
		</>
	);
}

Page.query = gql`
	query {
		generalSettings {
			title
			description
		}
	}
`;
```
