When editing content in the [WordPress editor](https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/), content creators can click the **Preview** link to preview what the content will look like on the frontend before the post has been published. This docs page outlines how to set up post previews in a headless WordPress app.

## Steps

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have completed the steps in the following pages before proceeding.

- [Basic setup](/docs/how-to/basic-setup)

- [Set up authentication](/docs/how-to/authentication/)

Implementing authentication is necessary so that Faust.js "knows" whether the current user has the permissions necessary to view draft posts. Template hierarchy support is necessary so that Faust.js can query for draft blog post data and render it using the appropriate page template.

### Step 1. Update the `_app.js` file

Navigate to `pages/_app.js` file and import your `faust.config.js` file that you have created in the previous steps like so:

```js title="pages/_app.js" showLineNumbers
import "@/styles/globals.css";
import "../faust.config"; // [!code ++]
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import { FaustProvider } from "@faustwp/core";

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
	const router = useRouter();

	return (
		<FaustProvider pageProps={pageProps}>
			<Component {...pageProps} key={router.asPath} />
		</FaustProvider>
	);
}
```

### Step 2. Create Preview Page

With your headless secret set and the `authorizeHandler` ready to handle requests, you can now create a Next.js [page](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) for previews. Create a file at `pages/preview.js` with the following code:

```js title="pages/preview.js"
import { WordPressTemplate } from "@faustwp/core";

export default function Preview(props) {
	return <WordPressTemplate {...props} />;
}
```

In this code block, We are using the `WordPressTemplate` component from `@faustwp/core` that will determine the correct page or post type to render based on the `wp-templates` hierarchy exports.

Just a note, we don't use the `getWordPressProps` here as opposed in some other `wp-template` pages as we want to perform post previews in the client using CSRs.

### Step 3. Add Preview Data to Your WPGraphQL Queries Within Templates

Now that we have everything set up, it is time to add post previews to your WPGraphQL queries. Navigate to your `wp-templates` folder. You should have a `single.js` from the template hierarchy step. This `single.js` file is the component that is responsible for rendering post-type data from WordPress. In your `single.js` file, add this code block:

```js title="wp-templates/single.js"
import { gql } from "@apollo/client";

export default function Component(props) {
	if (props.loading) {
		return <>Loading...</>;
	}

	const { title, content } = props?.data?.post;

	return (
		<>
			<h1>{title}</h1>
			<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: content }} />
		</>
	);
}

Component.query = gql`
	query GetPost($databaseId: ID!, $asPreview: Boolean = false) {
		post(id: $databaseId, idType: DATABASE_ID, asPreview: $asPreview) {
			title
			content
			# Add additional fields here if necessary
		}
	}
`;

// Variables function to provide the required arguments to the query
Component.variables = ({ databaseId }, ctx) => {
	return {
		databaseId,
		asPreview: ctx?.asPreview,
	};
};
```

In this code, the GraphQL query has an optional `asPreview` parameter. This parameter is passed in via the context `(ctx)`, determines whether the component should fetch preview data for a post when `asPreview` is true, or the published version when false.

This approach allows for dynamic previews of WordPress content directly on the frontend. Additionally, the component includes a loading state to handle scenarios where the data is still being fetched during client-side rendering (CSR). By displaying a loading message when `props.loading` is true, the component ensures a smooth user experience by preventing errors due to undefined post data.

If the `asPreview` parameter is not required for a specific template, you can omit it, effectively disabling previews for that component.

### Step 4. Navigating to Preview Pages

> [!TIP] For Safari Users
>
> Safari has an active bug where `Secure` cookies cannot be set on `localhost`, even when other browsers allow them. (Faust sets a `Secure` cookie for its auth implementation). See the [WebKit bug report](https://bugs.webkit.org/).
>
> For `localhost`, it is advised to set up [**HTTPS**](https://web.dev/articles/how-to-use-local-https), which will make previews work with Safari.

Start by logging into your WordPress Admin. For this example, we'll create a new post.

So far, I've added a title and a simple line of text for the content. To view this post as a preview on your front end, click the `Preview` link (1). From there, click, `Preview in new tab` (2):

Notice that the `Publish` button is also visible, meaning that you still need to publish the post. Therefore, you can now view the post on the frontend without being authenticated.

Clicking on `Preview in new tab` should take you to your post preview page with the current preview content:
