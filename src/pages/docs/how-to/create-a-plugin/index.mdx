Faust plugins are a structured way to extend or alter the framework's behavior, very much like WordPress plugins do in a traditional WordPress environment. Instead of `PHP`, however, Faust's plugins are written in JavaScript/TypeScript, leveraging actions and filters to deliver similar flexibility in a headless architecture.

## Steps

### 1. Basic setup

If you haven't already, follow the [Basic Setup](/docs/how-to/basic-setup/) steps to get Faust.js set up.

### 2. Create A Plugins Folder and file

In its very basic form, a Faust Plugin is a JavaScript class with an `apply` method. This apply method has a parameter called `hooks`, which is passed from `@wordpress/hooks`. Create a folder in the root of your Faust project called `plugin`. In the folder, create a file called `SamplePlugin.js`. In this file, add this code block:

```js title="plugins/SamplePlugin.js"
import { FaustHooks } from "@faustwp/core";

export class MyPlugin {
	/**
	 * @param {FaustHooks} hooks
	 */
	apply(hooks) {
		// Plugin logic goes here
	}
}
```

The `hooks` parameter is an object which contains the functions `addFilter` and `addAction`, amongst others. You can then use these functions to call the respective actions and filters to tap into Faust like so:

```js {10-16} title="plugins/SamplePlugin.js "
import { FaustHooks } from "@faustwp/core";

export class MyPlugin {
	/**
	 * @param {FaustHooks} hooks
	 */
	apply(hooks) {
		const { addAction, addFilter } = hooks;

		addFilter(
			"possibleTemplatesList",
			"my-namespace",
			(possibleTemplates, context) => {
				// Filter logic goes here.
			},
		);
	}
}
```

> [!important] Please Note
> `experimentalPlugins` is being deprecated and replaced with `plugins` in the `faust.config.js` file.
> Please update your configuration accordingly.

### 3. Add The Plugin to the Faust Config

You can then implement the plugin by adding it to the plugins property in the App's `faust.config.js` file:

```js title="faust.config.js"
import { setConfig } from "@faustwp/core";
import templates from "./wp-templates";
import possibleTypes from "./possibleTypes.json";
import { MyPlugin } from "./plugins/MyPlugin.js";

/**
 * @type {import('@faustwp/core').FaustConfig}
 */
export default setConfig({
	templates,
	plugins: [new MyPlugin()],
	possibleTypes,
});
```
