`WordPressBlocksViewer` is a component used to render blocks received from WordPress. It uses the React components passed to the `WordPressBlocksProvider` and matches them to the appropriate blocks received in the `editorBlocks` prop.

## Usage

The below example shows how a [Faust Template](https://faustjs.org/reference/template-system/) can use the requested `editorBlocks` from WPGraphQL and render them using the `WordPressBlocksViewer` component.

```js title="wp-blocks/CoreColumn.jsx"
import { WordPressBlocksViewer } from "@faustwp/blocks";

export default function Component(props) {
	const { editorBlocks } = props.data.post;

	return (
		<>
			<WordPressBlocksViewer blocks={editorBlocks} />
		</>
	);
}

Component.query = gql`
	query GetPost($databaseId: ID!) {
		post(id: $databaseId, idType: DATABASE_ID) {
			editorBlocks(flat: false) {
				__typename
				renderedHtml
			}
		}
	}
`;

Component.variables = ({ databaseId }, ctx) => {
	return {
		databaseId,
	};
};
```

It requests the `editorBlocks` without flattening them all in a single list (using `flat: false`). If set to `flat: true` it will put all of the blocks including `innnerBlocks` in a list and which you can use the `flatListToHierarchical` helper to put them back together in the right order.

By default the `WordPressBlocksViewer` component will use the `renderedHtml` property to render all the blocks in the page one by one.

## Props

Below is `WordPressBlocksViewer`'s props defined as a TypeScript interface:

```ts
export interface ContentBlock {
	__typename?: string;
	apiVersion?: number;
	cssClassNames?: string;
	innerBlocks?: ContentBlock[];
	isDynamic?: boolean;
	name?: string;
	renderedHtml?: string;
}

export interface WordPressBlocksViewerProps {
	blocks: ContentBlock[];
	fallbackBlock?: React.FC<ContentBlock>;
}
```

> [!note] The `blocks` type defined below is data received from WPGraphQL and the [WPGraphQL Content Blocks](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks) companion plugin.
