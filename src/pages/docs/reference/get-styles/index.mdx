export const metadata = {
	title: "getStyles",
};

The `getStyles` is a helper function that is used to calculate the inline styles of a block given the current theme and block properties. This is mainly useful when developing blocks taken from the [core WordPress blocks list](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/core-blocks/).

## API

The `getStyles` has the following signature:

```ts
function getStyles<T extends BlockWithAttributes>(
  theme: BlocksTheme,
  block: T,
): React.CSSProperties {..}

interface BlockWithAttributes extends ContentBlock {
  attributes?: Record<string, unknown> | null;
}
```

The arguments are as follows:

- `theme`: An object of type `BlocksTheme`. This is a refined type that contains several key fields extracted from the WordPress theme's `theme.json` file.
- `block`: The current block object containing data and attributes. This is typically the block data fetched from the API using the `editorBlocks` field. This has type that extends `BlockWithAttributes` which is a type of `ContentBlock`.

## Usage

Below is an example of using the `getStyles` helper, together with the `useBlocksTheme` to get the current theme object.

```js
import { useBlocksTheme, getStyles } from "@faustwp/blocks";

export function CoreCode(props) {
	const theme = useBlocksTheme();
	const style = getStyles(theme, props);
	const { attributes } = props;

	return (
		<pre style={style} className={attributes?.cssClassName}>
			<code dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: attributes?.content ?? "" }} />
		</pre>
	);
}
```

First it gets the current theme object using the `useBlocksTheme` hook as provided by the library. Then it uses this as a parameter together with the block properties (props) that is passed by the [`WordPressBlocksViewer`](/docs/reference/wordpress-blocks-viewer) component.

The `getStyles` helper will then check the theme and the block properties and create a style object that contains inline CSS of type `React.CSSProperties`. You can use this object as a `style` property in the block you are building. In the example above, it assigns the `style` attribute to the `pre` element.

The inline styles will be in the form of CSS custom properties (CSS variables) detected based on the provided parameters. For example given the following block props:

```js
{
  attributes: {
    textColor: "secondary",
    backgroundColor: "cyan-bluish-gray"
  }
}
```

The inline styles generated will be:

```js
{
  backgroundColor: 'var(--wp--preset--color--cyan-bluish-gray)',
  color: 'var(--wp--preset--color--secondary)'
}
```

> [!note] Currently the `getStyles` prefixes the CSS variable using the same `wp--preset` prefix rules as WordPress. Check out the [preset guide rules](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/#presets) to see what variables are being generated.

Now given the assigned CSS variables you have two options regarding their styles:

### Option 1: Define your own CSS Variables

You can go ahead and create a `:root` rule and place all the relevant CSS variables for the available styles. This might not scale well if you change the general theme of the website since these changes are difficult to track.

```css
:root {
	--wp--preset--color--black: #000000;
	--wp--preset--color--cyan-bluish-gray: #abb8c3;
	--wp--preset--color--white: #ffffff;
	--wp--preset--color--pale-pink: #f78da7;
	--wp--preset--color--vivid-red: #cf2e2e;
}
```

### Option 2: Use the `generateGlobalStylesheet` command from faust-cli

The `faust-cli` package supports querying and downloading the global CSS stylesheet from the WordPress site WPGraphQL endpoint.

The WordPress global stylesheet can be grabbed at build time by using the `faust generateGlobalStylesheet` command.

```json title="package.json"
scripts": {
    "dev": "faust dev",
    "build": "faust build",
    "generate": "faust generatePossibleTypes && faust generateGlobalStylesheet",
    "start": "faust start",
    ...
}
```

It will download a file named `globalStylesheet.css` which you can import into the project. This stylesheet will contain all the required CSS custom properties (CSS variables) definitions based on the theme's `theme.json` object. The benefit here is that it will also generate relevant CSS classes as well and assigns them into the HTML tags, providing greater style parity between the editor view and the decoupled Site.

```js title="_app.js"
import "../globalStylesheet.css";
```

## Additional Info

Proper block styling parity between the Gutenberg Editor and the Decoupled site is overall very tricky. Consider the following steps and considerations to achieve a better result.

### A. Import the @wordpress/base-styles and @wordpress/block-library packages

Both packages contain some necessary block view general styles and inline styles for the Core Reference Blocks. Since they are not included in the globalStylesheet.css you may need to include them in your styles to fill the missing gaps. The following SCSS import declarations should cover the whole spectrum:

```scss title="_block.scss"
// WordPress block styles.
// Used in `components/ContentWrapper`

@use "sass:math";

@import "@wordpress/base-styles/mixins";
@import "@wordpress/base-styles/colors.native";
@import "@wordpress/base-styles/z-index";
@import "@wordpress/base-styles/default-custom-properties";
@import "@wordpress/base-styles/colors";
@import "@wordpress/base-styles/variables";
@import "@wordpress/base-styles/breakpoints";
@import "@wordpress/block-library/src/style";
@import "@wordpress/block-library/src/theme";
```

### B. Assign the correct CSS classes

A lot of block styling is applied using CSS classes. For example when a paragraph block has a text color of `Primary`, Gutenberg will assign the class names `has-primary-color` and `has-text-color`. Certain class names contain specific CSS rules and if you find you are missing those you will need to update your `globalStylesheet.css` or just override them with custom styles.

### C. Add missing block styles injected using hooks

Enqueued styles and scripts as a result of certain actions like [`wp_enqueue_style`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_style/) are not handled by Faust.js currently. If your block injects scripts or styles via that method, you will need to manually include them in your decoupled Faust.js app's stylesheet.
