Faust.js uses `@apollo/client` under the hood to perform GraphQL operations against your WordPress backend. Having a solid understanding of Apollo Client queries, fragments, and mutations will help you get the most out of Faust.js.

## Apollo Client GraphQL Concepts

Below are core concepts for Apollo and GraphQL with links to the docs for your reference.

- [Queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries) – Retrieve data from your WordPress site.
- [Fragments](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/fragments) – Modularize your queries to make them more maintainable.
- [Mutations](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/get-started/concepts/graphql#mutations) – Update data in your WordPress backend.
- [Apollo Client Cache](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration) – Cache responses to minimize network usage.

### Faust.js-Specific Notes

- You don’t need to create or configure the client object yourself; Faust handles that for you.
- You can still customize the underlying Apollo Client via plugin filters if you need advanced configuration.
